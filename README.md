Hey there! I'm Niminae!

I never thought I would be learning how to code. Normally I dabble in social science, literature, and even philosophy. That said, I've always admired engineers and designers, *especially* game designers. That's why I finally decided to add technical skills to my repository. This is going to be quite the adventure, and I'm excited!
